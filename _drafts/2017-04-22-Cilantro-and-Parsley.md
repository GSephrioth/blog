Cilantro and Parsley

Today is weekend, I want to make some Chinese dumplings with my roommates. And I need some pork, chive, bok choy，shepherd's purse, cilantro, and dumpling skin

When shopping at 'Cermack', I found some thing looks like *Cilantro*, but named as *Parsley*. I thought *Parsley* might be a multiple name of *Cilantro*, So I brought them.

But after dumplings were made and cooked, we found the smell is little bit strange, and those dumplings also tastes different. I realized that I brought Parsley instead of Cilantro. 

I found both names on google translator, and got the same chinese word. Than I look through the diffen.com and found they are totally different.

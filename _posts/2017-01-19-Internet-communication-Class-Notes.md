Lecture 2 & 3

# overview of OSI MODEL and TCP/IP protocol suite

## network model

## layered network arctitecture
	highter layer use service provided by lower layer

## Basic divies of the layers
	
	1. [application]
	2. [transport] <- TCP/UDP
	3. [network] <- IP (packet)
	4. [dataline] <- physical address (frame)
	5. [physical]

## IP address (classful addressing)
* netid & hostid
* classes and blooks
* packet (payload + header)
* network address
* special addresses
* private addresses
* unique/ mulitycast/ boardcast
* mask and routing
* subnetting (divide large blocks)
* supernetting (combine small blocks)

## IP address (classless addressing)
* varable length blocks
* subnetting
* address location with Egs.

## delivery and forwarding and routing of packets
* direct/ indirect delivery
* routing table
* forwarding techniques
* forwarding with classful addressing
* forwarding with classless addressing
* static/ dynamic routing

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
>maping Logical address & physical address

* packet format
* encapsulation
* cache table
* queues
* input model
* output model
* cache control model

## Internet Protocol (IP)
>aim at end to end packet deliverly

* datagram
* fragmentation (adjust size of packet to suit different frames)
* options
* header adding model
* processing model
* queues
* routing table
* forwarding model
* reassembly model
* reassembly table

## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
>aim at program to program deliverly

* port number
* socket address (IP + port)
* connectionless serves (faster but not reliable)
* encapsulation and decapsulation
* UDP package

## Transmission Control Protocol  (TCP)
* process-to-process communication (P2P communication)
* connection-oriented service (reliable but slower)
* numbering system (incase of loseing package)
* flow control (speed difference between processes)(slid window flow control)
* congestion control
* segment format
* encapsulation and decapsulation
* connection establishment and termination
* data transfer
* sliding window protocol
* TCP timers
